    /* I guess for most of the linked list based question the intuition is to use two pointer, the slow and the fast pointer.
    - Base case: If the list contains only one node, the return the list
    - Initialize slow and fast pointer to head.
    - Here, slow pointers moves by one step, while the fast pointers moves by two steps at a time.
    - This way works because, as the fast pointer reaches end which is x distance, 
    slow pointer reaches x/2 distance which basically is the middle of the linked list.
    - If the no. of nodes is odd, this thing works. But when no. of nodes is even return the slow -> next i.e., 
    the second middle element.
    - How to know if no. of nodes is odd or even. If curr -> next == NULL (which is last node) then the no. of nodes is odd 
    (fast jumps from 1, 3, 5, ... 2x + 1, NULL). If curr -> next -> next == NULL (which is last but one node) then the 
    no. of nodes is even.
